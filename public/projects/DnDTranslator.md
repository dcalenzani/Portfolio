# DnD Translator

## Introduction

DnD Translator is a tool to translate any text from English to Spanish. The original purpose of this script was to translate the spells from the Players Handbook and provide a CSV table for the players with the translation, but I quickly realised this could be used for any kind of text, specially academic texts. Hence, DnD Translator does not pretend to be a TTRPG tool only, but hopes to actually grow to more contexts where a translation and tabulation is needed. 

## Translating with computers
_Traduttore tradittore_
- Different methods of machine translation

## Apertium vs. LibreTranslate
- Complexity of the script
- O Times
- Quality of translation

## Concluding Thoughts
- Benefits of Apertium relying heavily on supervised translating
- Benefits of quality of translation in tokenization models
