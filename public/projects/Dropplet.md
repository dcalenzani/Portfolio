# Dropplet

## Introduction
Dropplet is an IoT system to manage your plants at home. It uses an ESP32 and a NodeJS server to interact through the web and allow you to monitor and water your plants as needed.

This application was born by the needs of a family member, which loves plants but is unnable to reach some of them with ease, since they are on a tall roof. This makes the watering and checking of this plants much harder than others, forcing to grow only "strong" varieties which do not need as much water, but still those die sometimes.

By using dropplet, my family member, and virtually anyone, could water their unreachable plants just by the pressing of a button.

On this few lines I'll explore the difficulties and learnings that I made while developing the first working version of Dropplet, and my recommendations to others. 

## Embedded systems

- Programming hardware
- Frameworks and electronics
- Memory handling
